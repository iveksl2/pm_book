### Objective function of capitalism
A company is a group of people that build a product or service that adds more value than the alternatives.  This is the 'objective function' of companies and capitalism. The fundamentals are often forgotten and as PMs that work in the day to day. This can have a beneficial effect in re-orientating your thinking in helping *others* improve. Thinking of oneself as an entereprenuer rather than just a "product manager" is a great heurestic that will align you with your company and enable you to make a plethora of good decisions. Note: To adopt this mindset you do not need to completely drink the libertarian cool aid as capitalism comes with tradeoffs.
