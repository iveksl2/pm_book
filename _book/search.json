    "text": "This project originally started as a collection of product management links I would collect in transitioning from a data scientist to a product manager. Given my background, the implicit motivation was using these principles as a foundation toward building a product building machine. You will see throughout this book, it my view that there is a lot of overlap between being product manager and being a CEO. Therefore broader enterpereneurhisp and economic concpets are very helpful to product managers.\nAfter working at Weights and Biases that stresses the value of good writing, or peraphs being an academic at heart, I decided to make these collection of links to a longer form e-book to refine the ideas and surface and gaps in my own knoweldge. I hope others embarking on a career in product management will find some of the ideas helpful. Steal and bring into their own game only the you find useful.\nPrinciples, like assumptions, are meant to be challenged, discussed and debated and it through this refinement process that they are in fact strenghted. This is to say feel free to reach out discuss these more. To quote Hugo Ponte \"violent opposition\" is welcomed.\nThis wiki will also contain perspectives from some of the best people I have worked with in the respective domain.\nAlthough i have learned so many tips and tricks from too many to list, a few people I have observed and worked with disproportionally influeced my thinking\n\n1.0.1 Acknowledgements & Influences\n\nJeremy Achin\n\nThe best entreprenuer & product manager I have ever worked with.\n\nGourab De\n\nThe best people manager I have worked with.\n\nIna Ko\n\nWelcomed my to transition to her team as a PM and learned the most from when starting out as a PM. Also was the best boss I had within product management.\n\nLukas Biewald (CEO of Weights and Biases and successful 2X entrepenuer)\n\nThanks for emphasizing the value of writing. Ive taken some of my ideas through his public interviews on the Gradient Dissent Podcast and observing from afar.\n\n\n\n1.0.1.1 Other Work\nDo you find some of this interesting?

    "text": "It is good to learn about the economic theory & principles useful to an entreprenuer. These are likelier to stand the test of time rather than the latest product managment framework fad. Product Frameworks can‚Äôt significantly depeart from these deeper economic principles. Adopting the mindset of thinking of oneself as an entereprenuer rather than just a ‚Äúproduct manager‚Äù is a great heurestic that will align you with your company‚Äôs c-suite and enable you to make a plethora of good decisions.\nCompanys Goal:\nA company is a group of people that build a product or service that adds more value than the alternatives. (Including the status quo) This is the ‚Äòobjective function‚Äô of capitalism in maximizing long term profit. Often times these fundamentals can be forgottedn as PM‚Äôs get lost in the day to day work.\nThis outlook can have a beneficial effect in re-orientating your thinking in helping others improve. Note: To adopt this mindset you do not need to completely drink the libertarian cool aid as capitalism comes with tradeoffs. I.E. Your favorite restaurant you rave about is a product of somebody elses labor and exemplifies the win/win principle. However, if prior to construction, there was a small duck pondthat was the beloved home to a flock of ducks, to build the restaurant, the business will ruthlessly dispose of the pond to build the restaurant. Capitalism comes with tradeoffs and this is where I partially depart from the good profit book I cite.\nEconomic Decision Making Principles [1]\n\nRisk Appetite & Expected Value\n\nProject A has a 90% chance of generating 100k while project B has a 50% chance of making 1M. While project B has a higher expected value, most employees will choose option A. (find citation)\n\nOpportunity Costs\n\nAssuming the best choice is made, it is the ‚Äúcost‚Äù incurred by not enjoying the benefit that would have been had by taking the second best available choice [2]\n\nComparitive Advantage:\n\nComparative advantage is the ability to produce a good or service for a lower opportunity cost. [3] The power in comparitive advantage is understanding the difference with absolute advantage as each person can potentially make a contribution, even if others can do everything better. As an example, envision a Doctor opens a new clinic. That doctor is a renaissance man that is also a great at taxation and billing. Should the Doctor both treat patienets and do the billing or should they focus on treating patients and outsource the billing work? [4]\nComparative advantage can help inform how jobs can be constructed to play to the strenghts of the individual rather than fitting the individual into a pre-defined cookie cutter job.\n\nSunk Costs\n\nUnrecoverable past expenditure. To argue for decision many of us often say, ‚Äúwell we already invested so much up until this point‚Äù.\n\n\nSources:\n\n[1] Good Profit - https://www.amazon.com/Good-Profit-Charles-G-Koch-audiobook/ - pg70 \n[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost \n[3] https://www.thebalancemoney.com/comparative-advantage-3305915 \n[4] Good Profit - https://www.amazon.com/Good-Profit-Charles-G-Koch-audiobook/ - pg72"

    "text": "‚ÄúSkate to where the puck is going, not where it has been.‚Äù ‚Äì Wayne Gretzky\n\nAs a product manager, you want to bet on product that have a tailwind. This provides a margin of safety where even if you don‚Äôt get everying else right, more users will acrue over time and it increases the likelihood of success. One must ask themselves will this product feature stand the test of time? Will users care about this 5 years from now or am I building on top of the next hadoop?\n\n\nAccording to Google Trends, we hit Peak Hadoop in June 2015. Spark crossed over Hadoop in search popularity one year later in June 2016, and for the last two years, Spark seems to have been at a plateau. pic.twitter.com/bvjRwBqZbL\n\n‚Äî Peter Wang ü¶ã ((pwang?)) August 15, 2019\n\n\nHeurestics & Tactics\nOne heueristic you can use is to focus on the things that will not change in the next 10 years. Jeff Bezos speaks this when building Amazon:\n\n\nHe knows that 10 years from now customers will still care about wide selection and fast delivery. No customer will every say ‚ÄúI love Amazon but I wish my packages were delivered slower‚Äù. An investment in improving delivery time will pay of now and in the future.\nIf you want to exercise your forecasting muscle and take it to the next level you can attempt to forecast future events and keeping a record of your predictions to asses your track record. Observe what works and what doesn‚Äôt. For the nerds, there are websites such as Metaculus that is home to a community of forecasters where you can compete and learn from others. In the tech industry where the term ‚Äúvisionary‚Äù is thrown around too losely, or worse yet, ‚Äòself labeled‚Äô visionaries, it is harder to show eveidence of this capability and develop a successful track record.\nStudy quantitative trends in your space\nIf you want to be very nerdy you can read up on good forecasting principles.\nExamples of Good Forecasters\n* Peter Wilderford (Best general forecaster I know)  * Jeremy Achin\n* Lukas Biewald\n* Dan Becker"
