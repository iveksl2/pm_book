    "text": "This project started as a collection of product management links I collected as product management best-practices. The links grew and this is a longer form book to provide deeper explanations on the concetps. I am writing the book partly for myself (to surface gaps in my knowledge) but I hope others embarking on a career in product management will find some of the ideas useful.\nI am of the belief that the best mindset one can adopt as a product manager is one of an entreprenuer. This book will have product management and entrepreneurship principles. Coming from a trading & data science background myself, this will have more of a quantitative & strategic lean. It is my belief that concetps like expected value, forecasting, and optimization are in fact very relevant to product management. Design and aesthetics of are tremendous importance and will be covered as well."

    "text": "It is good to learn about the economic theory & principles useful to an entreprenuer. These are likelier to stand the test of time rather than the latest product managment framework fad. Product Frameworks can‚Äôt significantly depeart from these deeper economic principles. Adopting the mindset of thinking of oneself as an entereprenuer rather than just a ‚Äúproduct manager‚Äù is a great heurestic that will align you with your company‚Äôs c-suite and enable you to make a plethora of good decisions.\nCompanys Goal:\nA company is a group of people that build a product or service that adds more value than the alternatives. (Including the status quo) This is the ‚Äòobjective function‚Äô of capitalism in maximizing long term profit. Often times these fundamentals can be forgottedn as PM‚Äôs get lost in the day to day work.\nThis outlook can have a beneficial effect in re-orientating your thinking in helping others improve. Note: To adopt this mindset you do not need to completely drink the libertarian cool aid as capitalism comes with tradeoffs. I.E. Your favorite restaurant you rave about is a product of somebody elses labor and exemplifies the win/win principle. However, if prior to construction, there was a small duck pondthat was the beloved home to a flock of ducks, to build the restaurant, the business will ruthlessly dispose of the pond to build the restaurant. Capitalism comes with tradeoffs and this is where I partially depart from the good profit book I cite.\nEconomic Decision Making Principles [1]\n\nRisk Appetite & Expected Value\n\nProject A has a 90% chance of generating 100k while project B has a 50% chance of making 1M. While project B has a higher expected value, most employees will choose option A. (find citation)\n\nOpportunity Costs\n\nAssuming the best choice is made, it is the ‚Äúcost‚Äù incurred by not enjoying the benefit that would have been had by taking the second best available choice [2]\n\nComparitive Advantage:\n\nComparative advantage is the ability to produce a good or service for a lower opportunity cost. [3] The power in comparitive advantage is understanding the difference with absolute advantage as each person can potentially make a contribution, even if others can do everything better. As an example, envision a Doctor opens a new clinic. That doctor is a renaissance man that is also a great at taxation and billing. Should the Doctor both treat patienets and do the billing or should they focus on treating patients and outsource the billing work? [4]\nComparative advantage can help inform how jobs can be constructed to play to the strenghts of the individual rather than fitting the individual into a pre-defined cookie cutter job.\n\nSunk Costs\n\nUnrecoverable past expenditure. To argue for decision many of us often say, ‚Äúwell we already invested so much up until this point‚Äù.\n\n\nSources:\n\n[1] Good Profit - https://www.amazon.com/Good-Profit-Charles-G-Koch-audiobook/ - pg70 \n[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost \n[3] https://www.thebalancemoney.com/comparative-advantage-3305915 \n[4] Good Profit - https://www.amazon.com/Good-Profit-Charles-G-Koch-audiobook/ - pg72"

This provides a margin of safety where even if you don‚Äôt get everying else right, more users will acrue over time and it increases the likelihood of success. One must ask themselves will this product feature stand the test of time? Will users care about this 5 years from now or am I building on top of the next hadoop?\n\n\nAccording to Google Trends, we hit Peak Hadoop in June 2015. Spark crossed over Hadoop in search popularity one year later in June 2016, and for the last two years, Spark seems to have been at a plateau. pic.twitter.com/bvjRwBqZbL\n\n‚Äî Peter Wang ü¶ã ((pwang?)) August 15, 2019\n\n\nHeurestics & Tactics\nOne heueristic you can use is to focus on the things that will not change in the next 10 years. Jeff Bezos speaks this when building Amazon:\n\n\nHe knows that 10 years from now customers will still care about wide selection and fast delivery. No customer will every say ‚ÄúI love Amazon but I wish my packages were delivered slower‚Äù. An investment in improving delivery time will pay of now and in the future.\nIf you want to exercise your forecasting muscle and take it to the next level you can attempt to forecast future events and keeping a record of your predictions to asses your track record. Observe what works and what doesn‚Äôt. For the nerds, there are websites such as Metaculus that is home to a community of forecasters where you can compete and learn from others. In the tech industry where the term ‚Äúvisionary‚Äù is thrown around too losely, or worse yet, ‚Äòself labeled‚Äô visionaries, it is harder to show eveidence of this capability and develop a successful track record.\nStudy quantitative trends in your space\nIf you want to be very nerdy you can read up on good forecasting principles.\nExamples of Good Forecasters\n* Peter Wilderford (Best general forecaster I know)  * Jeremy Achin\n* Lukas Biewald\n* Dan Becker"
