    "text": "It is good to learn about the economic theory & principles useful to an entreprenuer. These are likelier to stand the test of time rather than the latest product managment framework. Product Frameworks can’t significantly depeart from these deeper economic principles.\nCompanys Goal:\nA company is a group of people that build a product or service that adds more value than the alternatives. (Including the status quot) This is the ‘objective function’ of companies and capitalism. Often times these fundamentals are often forgotten as PMs that work in the day to day.\nThis outlook can have a beneficial effect in re-orientating your thinking in helping others improve. Thinking of oneself as an entereprenuer rather than just a “product manager” is a great heurestic that will align you with your company and enable you to make a plethora of good decisions. Note: To adopt this mindset you do not need to completely drink the libertarian cool aid as capitalism comes with tradeoffs. I.E. Your favorite restaurant that you often frequent and rave about is a product of somebody elses labor and exemplifies the win/win principle. However, if prior to construction, if there was a small duck pond is the beloved home to a flock of ducks, to build the restaurant, the the restaurant will ruthlessly remove the pond to build the restaurant. Capitalism comes with tradeoffs and this is where I partially depart from the good profit book I cite.\nEconomic Decision Making Principles [1]\n\nRisk Appetite & Expected Value\n\nProject A has a 90% chance of generating 100k while project B has a 50% chance of making 1M. While project B has a higher expected value, most employees will choose option A. (find citation)\n\nOpportunity Costs\n\nAssuming the best choice is made, it is the “cost” incurred by not enjoying the benefit that would have been had by taking the second best available choice [2]\n\nComparitive Advantage:\n\nComparative advantage is the ability to produce a good or service for a lower opportunity cost. [3] The power in comparitive advantage is understanding the difference with absolute advantage as each person can potentially make a contribution, even if others can do everything better. As an example, envision a Doctor opens a new clinic. That doctor is a renaissance man that is also a great at taxation and billing. Should the Doctor both treat patienets and do the billing or should they focus on treating patients and outsource the billing work? [4]\n\nSunk Costs\n\nUnrecoverable past expenditure. To argue for decision many of us often say, “well we already invested so much up until this point”.\n\n\nSources: * [1] Good Profit - https://www.amazon.com/Good-Profit-Charles-G-Koch-audiobook/ - pg70  * [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost  * [3] https://www.thebalancemoney.com/comparative-advantage-3305915  * [4] Good Profit - https://www.amazon.com/Good-Profit-Charles-G-Koch-audiobook/ - pg72"

    "text": "Why you shouldn’t just build everything a customer asks for\nAs a PM one wants to maximize the impact of a product line and build features that effect as many users as possible. The danger of blindly building a feature a customer asks for, is it is overfit or overly customized for a specific customer and it will not benefit others. Furthermore, customers typically speak in the context of what is in front of them and don’t necessarily forecast the industry 5 years ahead.\n“Users will tell you incremental improvements, they won’t tell you to build the next Iphone” - William Falcone (PyTorch Lightning Founder)\nThink of it another way, if success was as easy as just doing what the customer says, every company would do it and succeed.\nThis should not be an excuse to not speak with customers. In fact, not doing so would be a huge mistake. However, it is important to evaluate the conversation in context."
