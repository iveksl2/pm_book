As a product manager, you want to bet on product that have a tailwind. This provides a margin of safety where even if you don't get everying else right, more users will acrue over time and it increases the likelihood of success. One must ask themselves will this product feature stand the test of time? Will users care about this 5 years from now or am I building on top of the next hadoop?

**Heurestics & Tactics**

One heueristic you can use is to focus on the things that will *not* change in the next 10 years. Jeff Bezos speaks this when building Amazon:

 He knows that 10 years from now customers will still care about wide selection and fast delivery. No customer will every say "I love Amazon but I wish my packages were delivered slower". An investment in improving delivery time will pay of now and in the future. 

If you want to  exercise your forecasting muscle and take it to the next level you can attempt to forecast future events and keeping a record of your predictions to asses your track record. Observe what works and what doesn't. For the nerds, there are websites such as [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/home/) that is home to a community of forecasters where you can compete and learn from others. In the tech industry where the term "visionary" is thrown around too losely, or worse yet, 'self labeled' visionaries, it is harder to show eveidence of this capability and develop a successful track record. 

Study quantitative trends in your space

If you want to be very nerdy you can read up on [good forecasting principles](https://iveksl2.github.io/ds_book/forecasting.html).
