**Heurestics & Tactics**

One heueristic you can use is to focus on the things that will *not* change in the next 10 years. [Jeff Bezos speaks this when building Amazon](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yCEX_Q5O0CI) He knows that 10 years from now customers will still care about wide selection and fast delivery.

There are websites such as [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/home/) that is home to a community of forecasters.

Study quantitative trends in your space
