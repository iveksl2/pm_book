# Introduction

This is the start of a book about product management. Coming from a trading & data science background myself, this will have more of a quantitative & strategic lean. It is my belief that concetps like expected value, forecasting, and optimization are in fact very relevant to product management. Dsign and aesthetics of are tremendously important and will be covered as well. 


Topics to cover: 

  * Economic principles & entreprenuership 
  * Strategy
  * Execution
  * Other principles
  * Product people management
