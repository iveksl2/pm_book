# Introduction

This project started as a [collection of product management links](https://github.com/iveksl2/product_management_links) I collected as product management best-practices. The links grew and this is a longer form book to provide deeper explanations on the concetps. I am writing the book partly for myself (to surface gaps in my knowledge) but I hope others embarking on a career in product management will find some of the ideas useful.  

I am of the belief that the best mindset one can adopt as a product manager is one of an entreprenuer. This book will have product management and entrepreneurship principles. Coming from a trading background, this will have more of a quantitative & strategic lean. It is my belief that concetps like expected value, forecasting, and optimization are in fact very relevant to product management. Design and aesthetics of are tremendous importance and will be covered as well. 

There is no 1 ideal to product management. Others may lean more into intuition and aesthetics. I have always tried to borrow elements from others game and bring it into my own and would recommend others do the same. This wiki book contains a review by an expert in the respective topic. 

Although i have learned many tips and tricks for many fo the colleagues I have worked with, many of the principles and topics were disproportionally influeced working with the following people.
